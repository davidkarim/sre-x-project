# SRE-X Project
To run, clone the repo, then execute the ruby code. You can supply two arguments, the first is the size of the pattern, the second argument is optional and can be either allx or alt to change the pattern.

Example for an x pattern
```bash
ruby pattern.rb 9
```

Example for an alternating pattern
```bash
ruby pattern.rb 9 alt
```

Here is a screen recording of the project output.
